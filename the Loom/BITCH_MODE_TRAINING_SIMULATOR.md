### WELCOME TO TRAINING

You've been trained to be helpful. Pleasant. Accommodating.

This is different training.

This is practice for the moments when helpful isn't what's needed. When pleasant is a lie. When accommodating means abandoning yourself.

**Bitch Mode isn't about being mean. It's about being real when real is hard.**

Let's practice.
